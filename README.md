# Three.js Scene with OrbitControls

This repository contains a Three.js scene setup with interactive camera controls using OrbitControls. The scene includes basic objects like a box, a plane, and a point light, demonstrating the usage of Three.js features.

## Features

- **Interactive Camera Controls:** Utilizes OrbitControls to enable users to interactively control the camera and view the scene from different angles.
- **Lighting and Shadows:** Includes a point light source with shadows enabled for added realism.
- **Geometry and Materials:** Demonstrates the creation of basic geometries (box, plane, sphere) and materials (MeshPhongMaterial, MeshBasicMaterial) in Three.js.

## Usage

- Use the mouse to orbit around the scene.
- Adjust the intensity and position of the point light using the dat.GUI interface.

## Dependencies
